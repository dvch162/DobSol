    "description": "Streamlined and automated system for managing real estate data",
    "problem": "TalkCondo went from having massive amounts of unusable real estate data to a streamlined, automated system that allows them to grow and scale.",
    "client": "TalkCondo",
    "clientBusiness": "TalkCondo is a marketplace that provides priority access to the hottest new condominium developments in the greater Toronto area before the public launch, helping clients save thousands.",
    "challenge": "Buying a condo in the Toronto area is a competitive process. That’s why TalkCondo wanted to build a platform (similar to Redfin or Zillow) that would aggregate all the information about new developments in one place for buyers, investors, and real estate agents. TalkCondo had access to an enormous amount of data for new towers before they were built, including detailed floor plans. But they didn’t have an efficient way to manage that data or upload it to their website.",
    "solution": "TalkCondo wanted to hire someone to organize all their information — until Neon Rain came up with an automated solution. After a thorough discovery process, Neon Rain developed a sheet-based import system to help TalkCondo manage their condo data more efficiently in a single database. Now, instead of having to click through 1500 condos to change a single field, the data team has a streamlined way to make daily updates and import information to the website. From there, Neon Rain built an integrated map that lets web users view condos by neighborhood and filter further by bedrooms, bathrooms, suite size, deposit, price, and more — so clients can easily find property listings that match their exact requirements.",

    "problem": "A large e-commerce retailer wanted to improve their website performance and user experience to increase conversions and customer satisfaction.",

    "clientBusiness": "The client is a well-known e-commerce retailer specializing in fashion, home goods, and electronics.",

    "solution": "Our team conducted a comprehensive website audit and identified performance bottlenecks. We implemented performance optimization techniques, including image compression, lazy loading, and caching. We redesigned the website with a clean and intuitive interface, improved navigation, and a mobile-responsive layout. Additionally, we implemented a seamless checkout process with multiple payment options, enhanced search functionality, and personalized product recommendations.",

    "problem": "A healthcare startup needed a mobile app to streamline patient appointments, medical records, and communication between doctors and patients.",
    "client": "Healthcare Startup",
    "clientBusiness": "The startup aimed to improve healthcare accessibility and efficiency by providing a platform for patients and doctors to connect seamlessly.",
    "challenge": "The client wanted a user-friendly mobile app that allowed patients to schedule appointments, access medical records, receive notifications, and communicate securely with doctors. The app needed to integrate with existing healthcare systems and ensure data privacy and security compliance.",
    "solution": "We developed a native mobile app for iOS and Android platforms that addressed the client's requirements. The app allowed patients to book appointments with their preferred doctors, view medical records, receive reminders, and securely message healthcare providers. We implemented robust data encryption and HIPAA-compliant security measures to protect patient information. The app integrated with the client's backend systems, such as electronic health records (EHR) and appointment scheduling systems, to provide real-time updates and seamless data synchronization.",
