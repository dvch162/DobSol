      "problem": "TalkCondo went from having massive amounts of unusable real estate data to a streamlined, automated system that allows them to grow and scale.",
      "client": "TalkCondo",
      "clientBusiness": "TalkCondo is a marketplace that provides priority access to the hottest new condominium developments in the greater Toronto area before the public launch, helping clients save thousands.",
      "challenge": "Buying a condo in the Toronto area is a competitive process. That’s why TalkCondo wanted to build a platform (similar to Redfin or Zillow) that would aggregate all the information about new developments in one place for buyers, investors, and real estate agents. TalkCondo had access to an enormous amount of data for new towers before they were built, including detailed floor plans. But they didn’t have an efficient way to manage that data or upload it to their website.",
      "solution": "TalkCondo wanted to hire someone to organize all their information — until Neon Rain came up with an automated solution. After a thorough discovery process, Neon Rain developed a sheet-based import system to help TalkCondo manage their condo data more efficiently in a single database. Now, instead of having to click through 1500 condos to change a single field, the data team has a streamlined way to make daily updates and import information to the website. From there, Neon Rain built an integrated map that lets web users view condos by neighborhood and filter further by bedrooms, bathrooms, suite size, deposit, price, and more — so clients can easily find property listings that match their exact requirements.",
